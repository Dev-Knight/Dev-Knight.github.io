**Hello World!** I am Dev Knight.

I am a sophomore at [ITER Bhubaneswar](http://www.iter.ac.in/), India.
I like to develop Web and android applications.

You can view some of my projects [here](https://Dev-Knight.github.io/projects/) or visit my [Github](https://www.github.com/Dev-Knight).

Technologies I prefer :

* Python 
  * Django
* C/C++
* Java
  * Android
* Javascript

On a side note, I also like to watch T.V series and Anime lot more than any average guy. **(Don't you message me any spoiler!)**. I also like to play WWE 2K16 and I love to code.

Feel free to say **[hi!](mailto:dev.knight2018@gmail.com)**.
